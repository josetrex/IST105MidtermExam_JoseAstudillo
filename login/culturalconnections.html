    <h2>cultural shock</h2>
    <article>
        <p>One of my culture shocks was that I should not use the tilde in my name, since my full name is José Luis.
            Another cultural shock is that here the cars do stop at the crosswalks and wait for you, in Ecuador this 
            did not happen and you had to wait for the cars to finish crossing before you could cross.

    <h2>Things that I miss</h2>
    <article>
        <p>I miss spending time with my dog and I miss eating empanada and morocho in the evenings while playing with my friends.
        </p>

    <h2>The most amazing thing that I love</h2>
    <article>
        <p>The thing that I really love is the freedom that comes from knowing that I can go out wherever I want without the fear of being robbed and killed. 
            Besides the fact that public transportation works here.
